# **Global Student Migration & Higher Education**

**Project Description**
---------------------------

In this project, I have used made data visualization to show relationship between different attributes and then used supervised machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting) to predit the placement status of the students. Among the algorithms that were used **Gradient Boosting*** showed the highest accuracy: **90.6%**
