# **Global Student Migration & Higher Education**

**Project Description**
---------------------------

In this project, I have used made data visualization to show relationship between different attributes and then used supervised machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting) to predit the placement status of the students. Among the algorithms that were used **Gradient Boosting*** showed the highest accuracy: **90.6%**

## 🚀 About Me
💻 AI & Data Science Enthusiast | 📊 Math Lover | 🚀 Exploring the Frontiers of AI

Hi there! I’m passionate about the world where mathematics meets data and transforms into real-world impact. With a strong foundation in traditional math and statistics, I love how data science bridges theory to practice—from modeling human behavior to solving complex real-life problems.

Always curious, I enjoy exploring the latest trends in AI, including GenAI, agentic systems, and machine learning innovations. I'm constantly building, learning, and pushing boundaries through hands-on projects.

📍Let’s connect through code, ideas, and data!.
